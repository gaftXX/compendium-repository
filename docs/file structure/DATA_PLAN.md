# Architecture Data - Note System Specification

**Purpose:** Complete specification of the note system architecture and all data categories

---

## Note System Overview

The note system is the core data structure of the application. It organizes all architecture-related information into 16 distinct categories, each designed to capture specific aspects of architecture practices, projects, and business operations.

### Design Principles
- **Office-Centric**: Architecture office names used as primary identifiers
- **Category-Based**: 16 specialized categories for different data types
- **Relational**: Notes can link to each other across categories
- **Flexible**: Metadata and tags for custom organization
- **AI-Accessible**: Structured for AI orchestrator queries

### Implementation Phases

**BASE BUILD (Initial):**
-  Architecture Offices (Core/Primary)
-  Regulatory and Zoning Influences

**FUTURE EXPANSION (14 categories to be added incrementally):**
- All other categories below

2. Extracts parameters:
   - office: "foster-partners"
   - category: "projects"
   - tags: ["sustainable"]
3. Executes query
4. Returns results

**User Input:** "What's the market share of luxury commercial in London?"

**AI Processing:**
1. Identifies intent: SEARCH_NOTES
2. Extracts parameters:
   - category: "market"
   - query: "luxury commercial London"
3. Returns market share data
